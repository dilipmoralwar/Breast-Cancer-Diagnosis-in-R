# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-in-R
# Data Science Project: Breast Cancer Diagnosis in R

**Steps:**
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Fitting
5. Performance Evaluation


The analysis and development of machine learning models were executed using the R programming
language, with the usage of several essential libraries:
❖ Caret: The Caret package was used for essential processes such as train-test data splitting
and cross-validation, assisting in model evaluation and selection.
❖ E1071: The E1071 package was utilized to implement Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithms, enabling the creation of effective classification models.
❖ randomForest: The randomForest package was employed for constructing Random Forest
models, which are ensemble learning methods known for their predictive accuracy.

❖ xgboost: The xgboost library was used to implement Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
algorithms, which are powerful for boosting and improving model performance.
❖ ggplot2: This library facilitated the creation of high-quality, customized data visualizations,
contributing to insightful data exploration.
❖ mgcv: The mgcv package was potentially used for fitting Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
and splines.
❖ ROCR: ROCR might have been utilized for generating Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curves and evaluating the performance of classification models.
